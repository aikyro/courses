    "### Golden Rules\n",
    "1. **Defense in depth** — Never rely on a single guardrail layer\n",
    "2. **Validate both input AND output** — The LLM can generate harmful content even from safe inputs\n",
    "3. **Fail safe** — When in doubt, block rather than allow\n",
    "4. **Audit everything** — Log what was caught and why for continuous improvement\n",
    "5. **Human-in-the-loop** — Keep humans in control of irreversible actions"
