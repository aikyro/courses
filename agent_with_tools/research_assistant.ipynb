    "### What We Built\n",
    "A **Research Assistant** agent with 4 tools using Google ADK.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Tool Definition**: Each tool is a Python function with a clear docstring\n",
    "2. **Agent Creation**: Wire tools to an LLM via `LlmAgent(tools=[...])`\n",
    "3. **Tool Selection**: The LLM reads docstrings and decides which tool to use\n",
    "4. **Multi-Tool Usage**: Complex questions can trigger multiple tool calls\n",
    "5. **ADK Runtime**: `Runner` + `SessionService` manages the execution loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "```\n",
